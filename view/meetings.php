              <p class="lead">Alcoholics Anonymous sparked in 1935 as one recovered alcoholic, Bill Wilson, shared his new found solution with
                an old drinking buddy Dr. Bob. This program of action developed rapidly as Bill and Bob travelled the country helping many
                hopeless alcoholics to find a new way of life. At ARCH we have learned through experience that the 12 Step Fellowships
                and their program of action are vital to continuous long term sobriety.</p>

            <p class="lead">Narcotics Anonymous originated in 1953 as an alternative to Alcoholics Anonymous. Guided by the same
              principles as Alcoholics Anonymous, NA has also proven to be an effective 12 Step Program of Action that has led
              millions to long term freedom from active drug addiction. NA produced it's own literature and altered the verbage
              of the 12 Steps to better suit the recovering addict that can not identify with alcoholism.</p>

            <p class="lead">12 Step Fellowships strive to help it's members 
              develop a spiritual way of living and some form of God 
              consciousness that will enable them to recover from their
              addiction. 12 Step literature and groups make clear that one's
              participation in any organized religion is not required, that 
              we only need to be open minded to spiritual principles in order to
              fully recover. Even still, many do come to find religion
              as a helpful tool that does nothing but strengthen their overall
              program of recovery. Feel free
